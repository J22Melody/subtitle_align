SRF,audio_aligned,64.06,84.81,75.70,46.85,baseline (our data)
SRF,audio_aligned + mean,76.94,93.47,88.58,72.38,already better than their model output
SRF,audio_aligned + median,77.66,93.36,89.74,74.83,^
SRF,audio_aligned + median + SAT (zero-shot),72.53,89.42,82.29,66.86,worse

SRF,audio_aligned + median + SAT (BERT + finetune),77.69,92.53,89.15,73.98,just meet the median baseline

SRF,audio_aligned + median + SAT (finetune BERT + finetune),76.74,92.43,87.89,72.88,finetune BERT does not improve
